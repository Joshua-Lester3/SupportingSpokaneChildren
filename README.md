# Supporting Spokane Children

Project built during Gonzaga's 2024 Hackathon. Was available at [https://supportingspokanechildren.net/](https://supportingspokanechildren.net/), but stopped the app service to reduce costs.

## Functionality

Allows for moderators to create, update, and delete announcements, events, and resources. Users are allowed to read these entities. Google and Microsoft are used as third-party auth to authenticate moderators/admins, with the possibility of authenticating users for posts in the future. 

## Tech Stack

Uses the framework Coalesce, by IntelliTect, which utilizes ASP.NET Core, Vue, and Typescript. Connected to Azure Cloud Services, using Azure Web App, SQL Server and Database, Key Vault, and Blob Storage.
